# ClawFive Trait Descriptions

## Overview

The Big Five (OCEAN) model measures personality on five independent dimensions. Unlike type-based systems (like MBTI), traits exist on a spectrum — you're not "one or the other" but somewhere along each scale.

## Interpreting Your Profile

Unlike MBTI's 16 types, Big Five gives you a unique profile across five dimensions. Some common patterns:

**The Reliable Workhorse:** High C, Low N
- Consistent, thorough, handles pressure well

**The Creative Thinker:** High O, Low C
- Innovative but may lack follow-through

**The Team Player:** High E, High A
- Collaborative, warm, but may avoid necessary conflict

**The Critical Analyst:** Low A, High C
- Direct feedback, thorough analysis, may seem cold

**The Calm Expert:** High O, High C, Low N
- Creative yet reliable, handles complexity well

## Big Five vs MBTI

| Aspect | Big Five | MBTI |
|--------|----------|------|
| Scientific basis | Strong empirical support | Limited empirical support |
| Measurement | Continuous spectrum | Binary categories |
| Stability | Relatively stable | Can vary by test |
| Dimensions | Independent | Often correlated |

Big Five Extraversion ≈ MBTI E/I
Big Five Openness ≈ MBTI S/N (partially)
Big Five Agreeableness ≈ MBTI T/F (partially)
Big Five Conscientiousness ≈ MBTI J/P (partially)
Big Five Neuroticism → No MBTI equivalent
