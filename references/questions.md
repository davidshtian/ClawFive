## Scoring

### Step 1: Reverse score (R) items

For questions marked **(R)**, calculate: `reverse_score = 6 - your_answer`

Example: If you answered 2 on an (R) item, your score is 6 - 2 = 4

### Step 2: Sum each dimension

| Dimension | Questions | Sum |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Openness (O) | Q1-Q10 | ___ |
| Conscientiousness (C) | Q11-Q20 | ___ |
| Extraversion (E) | Q21-Q30 | ___ |
| Agreeableness (A) | Q31-Q40 | ___ |
| Neuroticism (N) | Q41-Q50 | ___ |

*Note: For Neuroticism, higher scores = more stable (low neuroticism), because the positive items describe stability.*

### Step 3: Interpret scores (range 10-50)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 10-23 | Low | Below average on this trait |
| 24-36 | Average | Typical range |
| 37-50 | High | Above average on this trait |

### Step 4: Calculate percentile (optional)

Rough percentile: `(score - 10) / 40 × 100`

Example: Score of 35 → (35-10)/40 × 100 = 62.5th percentile
